These externalities may be serious: some have attributed recent election outcomes and future massive-scale job loss to computing technologies (at least in part), even suggesting that we need a new \u201csocietal business model\u201d [1].

One does not need to be \u201cinterested\u201d in security to be accountable for creating secure programs; anyone who will be responsible for maintaining or building any computer systems will be accountable.  Have you been or do you know anyone who has been a victim of a data breach? Data breaches have become commonplace with the causes often being a simple security mistake/piece of insecure infrastructure with a massive impact. Do you see yourself building a simple application that handles user data? You would have a responsibility to protect your users\u2019 data. Are you interested in cybersecurity as a specialization or career path? You\u2019ll probably get to advise the design of systems to be secure from the ground up and mitigate security incidents in real time. And finally: do you envision yourself in a role where you will either build or manage any systems that people will use? Then your systems need to be secure.  Systems, software, and tools that we use are all vulnerable to security breaches and incidents. However, security, historically and still today, is often an afterthought in the design of computer systems, which only exacerbates their vulnerability. And while cybersecurity itself is a huge and exciting field for those interested, there are core aspects of security that are accessible to and necessary for anyone in a computing-related occupation.",

To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.  The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice. We will study concepts such as differential privacy, database anonymization, anonymous communication, and algorithmic fairness.

Performance-critical systems and application software would be impossible to build and evolve without compilers that derive highly optimized machine code from high-level source code that humans can understand. Understanding what modern code analysis and transformation techniques can and can't do is a prerequisite for research on both software engineering and computer architecture since hardware relies on software to realize its potential.

This course introduces students to the basic principles and practices of computer system and networking security, with detailed analysis of real-world examples and hands-on practice. Topics include the basic crypto, authentication, reverse engineering, buffer overflow attacks, vulnerability scanning, web attacks, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc. We will first introduce the basic theory for each type of attack; then we will actually carry them out in 'real-world' settings. The goal is to learn security by learning how to view your machine from a hacker's perspective. In addition, we encourage students to participate in the UCSB International Capture the Flag Competition. Capture the Flag is a network security exercise where the goal is to exploit other machines while defending your own. In fact, this course should prepare you for any one of many capture the flag competitions that take place year-round.  We will learn about different types of hacks and perform them. After learning how to execute such exploits and penetrate a network, we will discuss ways to protect a network from others exploiting the same vulnerabilities. Understanding security is essential in all fields of software development and computing.  For major or minors in Computer Science, this course can satisfy the system breadth.",

One does not need to be \u201cinterested\u201d in security to be accountable for creating secure programs; anyone who will be responsible for maintaining or building any computer systems will be accountable.  Have you been or do you know anyone who has been a victim of a data breach? Data breaches have become commonplace with the causes often being a simple security mistake/piece of insecure infrastructure with a massive impact. Do you see yourself building a simple application that handles user data? You would have a responsibility to protect your users\u2019 data. Are you interested in cybersecurity as a specialization or career path? You\u2019ll probably get to advise the design of systems to be secure from the ground up and mitigate security incidents in real time. And finally: do you envision yourself in a role where you will either build or manage any systems that people will use? Then your systems need to be secure.  Systems, software, and tools that we use are all vulnerable to security breaches and incidents. However, security, historically and still today, is often an afterthought in the design of computer systems, which only exacerbates their vulnerability. And while cybersecurity itself is a huge and exciting field for those interested, there are core aspects of security that are accessible to and necessary for anyone in a computing-related occupation.",

The goal is to learn security by learning how to view your machine from a hacker's perspective. In addition, we encourage students to participate in the UCSB International Capture the Flag Competition. Capture the Flag is a network security exercise where the goal is to exploit other machines while defending your own. In fact, this course should prepare you for any one of many capture the flag competitions that take place year-round.  We will learn about different types of hacks and perform them. After learning how to execute such exploits and penetrate a network, we will discuss ways to protect a network from others exploiting the same vulnerabilities. Understanding security is essential in all fields of software development and computing.  For major or minors in Computer Science, this course can satisfy the system breadth.",

To ensure the privacy of sensitive data, privacy mechanisms have been developed to preserve the privacy of data without reducing its functionality.  The goal of this course is to introduce you to the concept and implications of data privacy, including mechanisms and protocols that are used to preserve data privacy in practice.

While we introduce the physical layer and have a goal of getting data to the internet at large, the focus of this course is on the wireless protocols themselves. How are packets structured, and why? How are they designed to enable low-power communication? How do they deal with contention and reliability? What makes them more or less suitable for different applications? We will explore local-area protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread (and other 802.15.4 protocols), low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) such as LoRaWAN and Sigfox, and other related topics such as backscatter and localization.  The class will include lectures on these topics as well as practical hands-on lab sessions interacting with networks. Starting very early in the class, students will form groups for their final project and create a proposal, allowing them at least 5 weeks for project work. Projects will culminate in a research-paper-style write-up and a class presentation.",

What does it feel like to move through the adult years and toward \"old age\"?  How do people's personalities, social relationships, and overall world view change as they grow older?  What does psychological and social science have to say about general trends, as well as individual differences, in aging?  This discussion-based and writing-intensive seminar is sequentially organized in terms of five cardinal themes:  (1) the social/emotional world, (2) generations, (3) memory and the self,  (4) loss, and (5) wisdom of the ages.  Within these five themes, the seminar will consider a range of psychological and social issues as they apply to adult development and aging, sampling some of the most provocative sources from fiction, drama, poetry, music, and cinema - and from the scientific literature.",

Their work formed the foundation of the field of behavioral economics. As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in the domains of medicine, public health, criminal justice, and sports. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve.

How does the source and type of knowledge interact with socio-political-cultural constructs and systems of power and, in turn, how can \"knowledge\" be used to produce and/or perpetuate power and privilege or to empower those who are marginalized? Finally, how does what we do in SESP and at Northwestern as both consumers and producers of knowledge fit within the landscape of these questions? In this course students will explore these and other questions to gain insight into the social production, distribution, consumption, interpretation, and operationalization of \"knowledge.\" Using primarily seminar-style discussion, the first portion of the course focuses on building and analyzing theoretical frameworks and applied texts in order to generate a working understanding of \"knowledge\" in its myriad forms. Among our goals for the first portion of the course is to tie theoretical, academic, and \"folk\" knowledges to everyday experiences and the world around us writ large. The second portion of the class will involve a series of applied of cases studies, including welcoming members of the SESP faculty community to present on their research, which we will work to bring into conversation with our generated frameworks regarding the sources, types, and implications of knowledge.",

While the main focus of the course is to discuss critical issues, there will also be an emphasis on public policy and political science writing formats, styles and standards. It cannot be emphasized enough how important research, analytic and writing skills are to virtually all careers; nothing is more quickly discrediting of good ideas than bad writing. The first half of class is mainly lecture and discussion. The second half of class has been designed to promote your learning as a writer and thinker in public policy. It will provide students with a designated forum for developing and \u201cwork shopping\u201d their written work and discussing issues covered in class. The TA will offer feedback on questions as students write, edit, and revise their papers. We will also frequently practice skills in responding critically to colleagues\u2019 texts.

Candidates will be asked to consider their own schooling experiences, and deeply evaluate their beliefs, thoughts and assumptions about the influence of various legal, historical, socio-cultural and linguistic factors on their ideas about teaching, learning, and schooling. Special attention will be given to the major trends that influence contemporary landscapes of PK-12 education and the potential systemic benefits and harms associated with them.

Teachers need tools and strategies to create and support an environment in which students feel welcome and responsible for contributing by sharing their ideas, building on one another\u2019s thinking, and working together to further their learning as a community. This course address how to support discourse in the classroom, including designing discussion-based tasks, supporting students in academic discourse, creating a classroom climate supportive of discussion, questioning strategies and talk moves that facilitate discussion, and assessment in discussion-based tasks. We will examine current approaches to supporting effective classroom discussions drawn from elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms, and across multiple disciplines including math, literacy, history, science, and others. Work in the course will involve discussing articles sharing discourse strategies and analyzing video of classroom interactions to see these approaches in action. Students will have the opportunity to work with the tools and strategies of the course in analyzing a classroom discussion they choose to observe, designing discussion-based lessons for their own teaching context, and to try out these tools in facilitating discussions with their peers.",

When an individual holds multiple identities that have traditionally been marginalized, any discrimination experienced will be different than someone without that unique blend of identities. To use Crenshaw's initial example in 1989, Black women experience a different type of racism than Black men, and a different form of sexism than White women. Thirty years later, researchers still are coming to terms with what this means in the public sphere, but also in research which underlines the importance of thinking about identity more comprehensively and completely. In this class, we will begin by addressing the question of what intersectionality is. We will also consider how considering identity as intersectional alters our understanding of policy, and what policy should address. Importantly, we will consider how to incorporate intersectionality into a basic framework of research and analysis through a term-long project.",
